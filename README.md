# First machine learning meeting.

## HomeWork:
> Dear Class:
> ---- You can finish these assignments with your partners or using search engine.Everyone needs to pay attention to __third assignments__ and send code to my email(rayestgeeta2018@gmail.com).Due 11/11 12:00 AM. The code files must be `.ipynb`.
>  1. Everyone needs to create a `GitHub` account. Then publish a issue on my GithHub's Regular-meeting-Homework'Issues.(Anything content is OK).
>  2. Download all the code files from today's regular meeting from my GitHub.(Theory_Basic and Brief-introduction.).Then try to run this code (that's easy.)and review this meeting.
>  3. Everyone needs to learn to use python in `Jupyter Notebook`(exited in Anaconda).If you don’t use python at all, please write python codes in `Jupyter notebook`.(You need to seed your practice code to me.)If you have been able to use python skillfully, please try to study `Numpy   Pandas  Matplotlib  Sklearn`(This is not necessary. If you can, please send it to me.). If you are proficient in the above, please study today's machine learning code and other machine learning algorithms.

## Recommended courses and books.
> - [吴恩达机器学习视频](https://study.163.com/course/courseMain.htm?courseId=1004570029)(It is biased towards the derivation of mathematical knowledge, but it is still quite useful.)
> - [数据分析与机器学习上](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av30300809)
> - [数据分析与机器学习下](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av30350558) (It is biased towards the interpretation of ideas and codes.)
> - Books about Python are available in library books. But please pay attention to borrowing books, please read the directory carefully, and then choose __python3__ version. If you want to buy books, I haven't found the suitable choice.

## Some website about Ubuntu.
> - [Ubuntu18.04 安装后应该做的事](https://blog.csdn.net/hymanjack/article/details/80285400)(Ignore 13.)
> - [Ubuntu 中文论坛](http://forum.ubuntu.org.cn/)
## Introduce:

>  - First, I talked about the boundaries between __artificial intelligence,machine learning and deep learning__.It is very important to distinguish them.
>  - Then, I introduced some basic knowledge of machine learning. 
>   >  1. Overfitting and Underfitting.
>   >  2. Cost Function.
>   >  3. Accuracy.
>   >  4. Learning curve.
>   >  5. Algorithm model optimization.
>   
> (The above contents and codes are in `Theory_Basic.ipynb`.)

## An example of machine learning.
>  We use `Digits datasets` to experience the whole process of machine learning. 
>   >  1. Introduction of Digits datasets.
>   >  2. Features selection.
>   >  3. Data cleaning.
>   >  4. Model selection(We choose SVM).
>   >  5. Model training.
>   >  6. Model test.
>   >  7. Model save and load.
